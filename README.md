# Maniac ðŸŒ€

**Maniac** is a Rust library focused on implementing, exploring, and benchmarking a wide variety of sorting algorithms. Its goal is to offer a collection of canonical and experimental sorting methods with an easy way to compare their performance against Rustâ€™s standard library sorter.

Whether you're learning how sorting works under the hood, experimenting with algorithm variants, or analyzing performance trade-offs â€” Maniac gives you the playground and tools to do it.

---

## Features

- âœ… A growing collection of sorting algorithm implementations
- âœ… A unified `Sorter` trait to abstract over sorting strategies
- ðŸš§ A planned `Benchmarker` utility for comparing sorting methods
- ðŸ§ª Built-in test suite for correctness
- ðŸ“¦ Designed as a minimal, zero-dependency library

---

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
maniac = "0.1.0"
```

---

## Usage

```rust
use maniac::{Sorter, comb_sorter::CombSorter};

let mut items = vec![5, 3, 1, 4, 2];
CombSorter::default().sort(&mut items);

assert_eq!(items, vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```

_(Full usage examples coming soon.)_

## TODO

- [ ] Implement all classic sorting algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap, Radix, etc.)
- [ ] Implement less common and exotic sorts (e.g. Comb, Shell, TimSort, Stooge)
- [ ] Create a `Benchmarker` struct or trait that can:

  - Take any dataset and run all available sorting strategies
  - Compare results to the standard libraryâ€™s `.sort()` in terms of time and allocations

- [ ] Add support for plotting or reporting benchmark results
- [ ] Provide rich examples and docs for each algorithm
- [ ] Test behavior on large datasets and edge cases
- [ ] Property testing with quickcheck or equivalent crate

Happy sorting! ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡
